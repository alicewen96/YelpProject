# YelpProject
It's late (or just an odd hour of the day) and I need a place to grab food right now. Help, I need Yelp.
This program can determine which top searches are still open, how much longer the establishments will be open, and how far away they are from one's current location.

Note: To run the collegeneeds.py, you will need to provide your own Client ID and Client Secret code (both of which can be requested through Yelp's Developer website).
